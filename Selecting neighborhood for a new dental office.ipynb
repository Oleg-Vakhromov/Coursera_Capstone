    "    Imagine you are a young aspiring dentist. You studied and worked hard and now ready to go into business on your own. It is a big decision and very expensive too. The bank is willing to lend you money but wants to make sure that you can earn enough to cover the loan payments. \n",

    "I'm starting with a hypothesis that it is possible to asses and rank neighbourhoods based on the level of competition. A single dentist can take care of a finite number of patients. Therefore we can calculate the maximum number of dentists for each neighbourhood and see how this number compares to the actual number of clinics.\n",
